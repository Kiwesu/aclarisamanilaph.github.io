    <h1>Jeepney</h1>

    <br>

    <p>Jeepneys <i>(Tagalog: 'dyipni')</i>, sometimes called jeeps <i>(Tagalog: 'dyip')</i>, are public utility vehicles, serving as the most popular means of public transportation in the Philippines. They are known for their crowded seating and kitsch decorations, which have become a widespread symbol of Philippine culture and art.</p>

    <br>
    <br>

    <p>Jeepneys originate from the American colonial period share taxis known as auto calesas, commonly shortened to "AC". These evolved to modified imported cars with attached carriages in the 1930s which served as cheap passenger utility vehicles in Manila. These vehicles were mostly destroyed in World War II. The need for replacement transport vehicles led to the use of U.S. military jeeps left over from the war, which became the template for the modern jeepney. The word "jeepney" is a portmanteau of post-World War II "jeep" and pre-war "jitney", both words common slang in the popular vernacular of the era. An estimated 600,000 drivers nationwide depend on driving jeepneys for their livelihood. In Metro Manila, an estimated 9 million commuters take the jeepney each day.</p>

    <h1>Slums</h1>

    <br>

    <p>Slums are traditionally described as dense urban settlements, usually displaying characteristics such as crowded and compact housing units, informal delivery of utilities, and unofficial recognition by local government. In the Philippines, residents of slum areas are commonly referred to as "squatters" and have historically been subject to relocation or forced demolition. With a steadily growing metropolitan area, Metro Manila is subject to a densifying population of slum dwellers—a 2014 article states that Manila has an estimated 4 million people living in slums, out of a total population of 21.3 million.</p>

    <br>

    <p>While a large number of slum residents would be considered poor according to the international poverty line of $1.25/day, not all who live in slums fall into this category.</p>

    <br>
    <br>

    <p>A measurement in 2010 states that around 50% of slum residents earn wages of $2-$4 USD a day, landing above the federal poverty line. One reason for this is that while some residents are employed in formal wage labor outside of the slums, there are no alternative housing options for them within a reasonable distance of their employment, thus forcing them to live in the highly impacted urban slums. Additionally, the reported poverty statistics may not be accurate due to political desires to maintain lower rates of poverty. Researchers suggest that up to an eighth of the slum population in Manila remains unaccounted for.</p>

    <h1>University of Santo Tomas </h1>

    <br>

    <p>The University of Santo Tomas (UST; Filipino: Pamantasan ng Santo Tomas), 
    officially the Pontifical and Royal University of Santo Tomas, Manila or colloquially
    as USTè (pronounced 'ustɛ'), is a private, Catholic research university in Manila, 
    Philippines. Founded on April 28, 1611, by Spanish friar Miguel de Benavides, third
    Archbishop of Manila, it has the oldest extant university charter in Asia and is one
    of the world's largest Catholic universities in terms of enrollment found on one campus.
    It is the main campus of the University of Santo Tomas System that is run by the Order of Preachers.
  
    <br>
    <br>

    UST's recognition as the oldest extant university in the Philippines was disputed by 
    the University of San Carlos. Since its establishment, the UST's academic life was 
    interrupted only twice; from 1898 to 1899, during the Philippine Revolution against 
    Spain, and from 1942 to 1945, during the Japanese occupation of the country. 
    On December 1, 2010, the House of Representatives passed Resolution No. 51, 
    "Resolution Congratulating the University of Santo Tomas on the occasion of its 
    Quadricentennial Anniversary in 2011," which read "founded on April 28, 1611, 
    by Archbishop Miguel de Benavides" and "has the oldest extant university charter in
    the Philippines and Asia."</p>

    <h1>Binondo Church</h1>

    <br>

    <p>Binondo Church (Tagalog: Simbahan ng Binondo), formally known as the 
    Minor Basilica and National Shrine of Saint Lorenzo Ruiz and also as 
    Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary Parish (Spanish: Basílica Menor y Santuario Nacional
    de San Lorenzo Ruiz y Parroquia de Nuestra Señora del Santísimo Rosario), 
    is located in the district of Binondo, Manila fronting Plaza San Lorenzo Ruiz, 
    in the Philippines. This church was founded by Dominican priests in 1596 to 
    serve their Chinese converts to Christianity. The original building was destroyed
    in 1762 by British bombardment. A new granite church was completed on the same site
    in 1852 however it was greatly damaged during the Second World War, with only the
    western façade and the octagonal belfry surviving.</p>

    <br>
    <br>

    <p>Lorenzo Ruiz, who was born of a Chinese father and a Filipino mother, trained in this
    church and afterwards went as a missionary to Japan, where he and his companions were
    martyred for refusing to renounce Christianity. Lorenzo is the Philippines' first saint,
    and was canonized by Pope John Paul II in 1987. A large statue of Ruiz stands in front of
    the church. Masses are held in Filipino, Mandarin, Hokkien, and English. As of 2022,
    the present parish priest and shrine rector is Esteban U. Lo. </p>
